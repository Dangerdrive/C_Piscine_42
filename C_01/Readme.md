Pointers are fundamental in the C programming language, serving as core components. They store memory addresses of variables, functions, or other pointers. With pointers, C programmers can access memory at a low level, dynamically allocate memory, and enable various other functionalities within the language.

Here is are some of the topics covered in C 01:

## Pointers:

- Pointer declaration, initialization, and assignment.
- Dereferencing pointers and accessing the value they point to.
- Pointer arithmetic and pointer arithmetic operations.
- Passing pointers to functions and using them to manipulate data.
- Pointers to pointers (double pointers) and their applications.

## Arrays

- Declaring and using arrays to store multiple values.
- Accessing array elements and performing array operations.
- Sorting arrays and searching for elements.

## Strings and Characters:
